# CSE-143-Database-Solutions

This repository contains solutions to the sample problems given in the CSE-143 Old Question Database for Winter 2019. This is an effort to help students get solutions to the sample problems, and to check and confirm the correctness of their own solutions.

I took the course myself in Winter 2019, and found out that there weren't any good resources to get the solutions of this vast database. So to help other students taking the class in the upcoming quarters, this repository will work as a tool and a guide enabling them to better prepare for exams.

If there is anything missing or incorrect please let me know!
